            <div class="only-center red-text">Biography of Vlaiden – The People’s Candidate</div>

  <p>Vlaiden was born in the small, peaceful province of <strong>Mini-Soda</strong> in Bobrdonia. Growing up surrounded by nature, hardworking neighbors, and, of course, beavers, Vlaiden learned the values of community, resilience, and humor early in life.</p>

  <p>For many years, Vlaiden brought joy to others by working as Santa Claus at New Year’s parties. Kids adored him, parents trusted him, and even the grumpiest guests couldn’t resist his cheerful “Ho Ho Ho!” Vlaiden became known as someone who could always bring people together with kindness and laughter.</p>

  <p>When he retired, Vlaiden thought his best years were behind him. He moved to a quiet retirement home, planning to spend his days watching TV and relaxing. But then, disaster struck. <strong>Donald Drunk</strong> came to power, and Vlaiden watched in horror as the country he loved began to fall apart.</p>

  <p>Drunk’s worst moment? Trying to replace the national beaver symbol with a statue of himself made of cheddar cheese. Vlaiden couldn’t take it anymore. “This is madness!” he shouted. Determined to save Bobrdonia, Vlaiden left his retirement home and joined the <strong>Democratic Party of the United Federation of Bobrdonia</strong>.</p>

  <div class="only-center red-text">Vlaiden’s Vision</div>
  <p>Even as a politician, Vlaiden hasn’t lost his charm. He still hands out candy canes and surprises crowds with his classic “Ho Ho Ho!” Vlaiden speaks honestly and doesn’t shy away from calling out <strong>Donald Drunk</strong>, whom he blames for almost turning Bobrdonia into a dictatorship.</p>

  <p>Here’s what Vlaiden stands for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Protecting Beavers</strong>: Vlaiden promises to grow the beaver population, calling them the heart and soul of Bobrdonia.</li>
    <li><strong>Equality for All</strong>: Vlaiden supports same-sex marriage, saying, “Love is love, for people and bobers alike!”</li>
    <li><strong>Boosting Rockets</strong>: Vlaiden will increase rocket production by 200%, making Bobrdonia a leader in innovation.</li>
    <li><strong>Never Again to Donald Drunk</strong>: Vlaiden is committed to keeping leaders like Drunk out of power for good.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="only-center red-text">A True Leader from Mini-Soda</div>
  <p>Vlaiden’s small-town roots, big heart, and sense of humor have made him a favorite across Bobrdonia. Whether he’s giving speeches, visiting schools, or just making people smile, Vlaiden reminds everyone that a brighter future is possible.</p>

  <p>With Vlaiden leading the way, Bobrdonia is ready to soar higher than ever—powered by rockets, unity, and, of course, beavers!</p>
